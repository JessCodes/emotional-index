# Emote Me
Emote Me is a Ruby on Rails web app that is the companion to the [Emote Me iOS](https://github.com/JessCodes/emotional-index-iOS) app our team built.  The Swift app looks at a photo of the user and analyzes the user's emotions.  Based on the emotion and user preferences, the app can show the user a YouTube video or gif to improve the user's mood or keep the mood high.

The Ruby on Rails web application allows users to set and update preferences and visit their profile page to see their emotions visualized in an easy to understand graphical form.  
 

[Hosted on Heroku](http://emotemetoo.herokuapp.com/).
